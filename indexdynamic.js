        <h3>What is sustainability?</h3>
        <p>Sustainability is far from a new concept. Indigenous peoples have
        practiced elements of sustainable living for generations by being in
        tune with the natural environment and its limits, cycles, and
        changes. This understanding is usually referred to as traditional
        ecological knowledge, or the deep knowledge and beliefs about
        relationships between people, plants, animals, natural phenomena,
        landscapes, and timing of events in a specific ecosystem.</p>
